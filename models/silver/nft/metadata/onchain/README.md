# On-chain Metadata

A number of projects on Flow post moment metadata to the chain when a moment is minted. This occurrs over a number of different categories. A moment typically is part of a set, and edition, and/or a series. A moment itself is a representation of a play in some sport or event. Thus, a moment may have a play id, set id, series id, edition id, and more. So, for a full representation of a moment's metadata, each of these components is required.
  
The models in this folder were built in at the end of 2022/early 2023 to parse a few projects that had begun to store metadata on chain. As more projects move to this approach, these models will be updated.
