# SILVER_CW

This directory is a copy of the silver directory with models downstream of the Chainwalkers source. Chainwalkers is being de-commissioned in October 2023, but the Streamline backfill will take some time to finish. These models are thus copied over as an archive of the Chainwalkers data, and to keep the new (streamline) models separate and organized.  
  
This entire directory may be deleted once Chainwalkers is fully deprecated.  
  
New models that have been migrated to use Streamline as a source are suffixed with `_s`. No suffix was added for models that do not require a migration (prices, labels, external APIs, etc.).
