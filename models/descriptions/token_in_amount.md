{% docs token_in_amount %}
The amount of tokens received by the trader (or next pool) in a DEX swap. Data type: NUMBER (decimal adjusted). Represents the quantity of the "in" token in the swap, from the trader's perspective. Used for volume analysis, price impact, and swap path tracing. Example: 49.5 (for 49.5 tokens received). Directionality is always from the pool to the trader or next hop in multi-pool swaps.
