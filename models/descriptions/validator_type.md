{% docs validator_type %}

The role or type of validator node in the Flow blockchain network. Data type: STRING. This field categorizes validator nodes based on their specific function in the consensus mechanism. Used for validator role analysis, network architecture understanding, and governance operations. Example: 'consensus' for consensus nodes, 'execution' for execution nodes, 'collection' for collection nodes, 'verification' for verification nodes, 'access' for access nodes. Critical for understanding Flow's multi-role validator architecture, network performance analysis, and maintaining the distributed consensus mechanism.
