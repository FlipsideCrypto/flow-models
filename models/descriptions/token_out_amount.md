{% docs token_out_amount %}
The amount of tokens sent out from the trader's wallet (or previous pool) in a DEX swap. Data type: NUMBER (decimal adjusted). Represents the quantity of the "out" token in the swap, from the trader's perspective. Used for volume analysis, price impact, and swap path tracing. Example: 50.0 (for 50 tokens swapped out). Directionality is always from the trader to the pool or next hop in multi-pool swaps.
