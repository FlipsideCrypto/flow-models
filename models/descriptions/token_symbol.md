{% docs token_symbol %}

Abbreviated symbol for the asset or token involved in the transaction. Data type: STRING. Used to quickly identify the type of asset (e.g., 'FLOW', 'USDC', 'BLT') in analytics, dashboards, and reporting. This field is essential for filtering, aggregating, and visualizing token-level activity, especially in bridge and DEX models. Example: 'FLOW' for Flow's native token, 'USDC' for USD Coin. Important for token attribution, price lookups, and user-facing analytics.
